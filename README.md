# Safee-Web-Application

### Using Django API Framework

#### To open the project:

##### 1. Go to your terminal and type ``` $ git clone https://github.com/raman934/Safee-Web-Application.git ```

##### 2. Move to the location where "ntcc_sem4" is present

##### 3. Type in your terminal ``` $ source ntcc_sem4/bin/activate ``` or if you are a windows user, create a venv by typing ```$ python -m venv VENV_NAME``` and then activate it by typing ```$ VENV_NAME\Scripts\activate```

##### 4. Now you have activated the virtual environment. Now install the dependencies using ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

NOTE: You can also see the list of tools you have in your venv, through ```$ pip list```

##### 5. Now move inside the web_application directory using ``` $ cd web_application/ ```

##### 6. Now type ``` $ python --version ``` and it should display python version 3 if it doesn't, try ``` $ python3 --version ``` or just install python 3 (Version >= 3.6)

##### 7. Now type ``` $ python manage.py runserver ``` or ``` $ python3 manage.py runserver ``` whichever works for you

##### 8. After checking that the server is working. Now go to the browser and type ``` localhost:8000 ``` in the address bar.

NOTE: These commands are for linux, also if any of this steps does'nt work, check if you have all the necessary resources installed.

This project will be deployed online soon.
